The threads avoid starvation by:

1. Limiting the number of consecutive performers of a single type that can
enter the stage.

One type of performer can only fill the stage one time before picking a new type
of performer to perform.

For dancers and jugglers the max is 4.
For soloists the max is 1.

Dancers can only pick jugglers and soloists.
Jugglers can only pick dancers and soloists.
Soloists can only pick dancers and jugglers.

2. Weighting the random pick of the new performer type based on how many there are
in each group.

There are 15 dancers so they can fill the stage ~4 times.
There are 8 jugglers so they can fill the stage 2 times.
There are 2 soloists so they can fill the stage 2 times.

Therefore, the dancer performer type will perform roughly twice as many times
as jugglers and soloists.

Dancers pick jugglers and soloists with and equal chance.
Jugglers pick dancers with twice the probability of soloists.
Soloists pick dancers with twice the probability of jugglers.

3. Each type of performer type only has to sleep for 3 performances before they
are guaranteed to be picked to perform.

This is done with a counter each time a performer type fills the stage.
